> correct the rxn selection loop

  current procedure:
  1. Find possible reactions, EXCLUDING reactants that have been selected for reaction in an earlier voxel's step
  2. Select a reaction

  new procedure:
  1. Find possible reactions, INCLUDING reactants that have been selected for reaction in an earlier voxel's step
  2. Select reaction. If the selected reaction uses a reactant that has been reacted in an earlier voxel's step, instead choose null reaction


> consistent naming/values
  - reaction ID vs number vs type, etc.
  - molecule ID, number, type, etc.
  - check all rate calculations and the units for A, Ea, kB, etc.
  - double check (AND DOCUMENT) the units of the official time kept


> loop over all voxels, not just voxels that have molecules in them (currently line 233)
  - this may cause a bug as get_rxns and spkmc_rxn and others may try to operate on empty voxels


> explictly track molecule types, as mapped to atom IDs
  - currently, molecule type is assigned by creating a sorted list of all atom types in the molecule, but this will break (without crashing) if isomers exist in the system
  - need to create some new file that will track this between reactive cycles


> work on nomenclature
  - MD cycle, reactive cycle, reactive step, etc.


> add OPTIONAL reaction scaling when calculating Rmax; it currently forces the use of reaction scaling
  - this should crash if reaction scaling is not being performed
  - make it look like line 276
